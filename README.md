# This simulation is how many Positrons are being emitted in the body from K-40 in the human body each SECOND!

# Approximately 3,333 atoms of K-40 decay in the body each SECOND!

# The average person emits approximately 4000 + (to approximately 5250) positrons per day! We emit 170-210 positrons per hour!

# This project is specifically on Beta + Decay of K-40!
