# This is what particle decay of K-40 in the human body

# 200,000 + atoms of K-40 decay in the body each MINUTE!

# 80 kg man emits 170-210 positrons per hour!

# This project is specifically on Beta + Decay of K-40, so the numbers here are for combined (Beta +) and (Beta -) Decay!

# If you want to use the code, please notify me about it! If you do, I'll be happy to give you permission!
